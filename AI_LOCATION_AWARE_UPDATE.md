# AI Assistant - Location-Aware Update

## What Changed

Your AI assistant is now **location-aware** and fetches real restaurant data based on your current location, not hardcoded to Cebu.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Geolocation Detection**
- Gets your current location automatically when the page loads
- Uses browser geolocation API
- Falls back to Manila, Philippines if location is denied

```typescript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => {
    setUserLocation([position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude]);
  }
);
```

### 2. **Real Data Integration**
- Uses `fetchRealFoodPlaces()` from `lib/restaurants.ts`
- Fetches actual restaurants from OpenStreetMap near your location
- No longer uses hardcoded Cebu restaurants

### 3. **Location-Agnostic Quick Actions**
Changed from:
- ‚ùå "Good coffee spot with cozy vibes in Cebu"
- ‚ùå "Budget-friendly restaurants"

To:
- ‚úÖ "Good coffee spot near me"
- ‚úÖ "Budget-friendly places near me"
- ‚úÖ "Fast food near me"
- ‚úÖ "Popular restaurants near me"

## How It Works Now

### Query Flow
```
User types: "Good coffee spot near me"
    ‚Üì

    ‚Üì

### Example Queries

| Query | What It Does |

| "Cozy cafes for working" | Finds quiet cafes suitable for work |

## Features

### ‚úÖ Location-Based
- Recommendations based on YOUR current location
- Works anywhere in the Philippines
- Automatically fetches nearby restaurants

### ‚úÖ Real Data
- Uses OpenStreetMap (same as your map page)
- Real restaurant names, ratings, locations
- Always up-to-date information

### ‚úÖ Smart Filtering
- Coffee/Cafe queries ‚Üí Shows coffee shops
- Budget queries ‚Üí Filters by $ pricing
- Fast food queries ‚Üí Shows quick meal options
- Local queries ‚Üí Filipino restaurants

### ‚úÖ Visual Cards
- Real restaurant images (when available)
- Ratings from your rating system
- Actual locations from OpenStreetMap
- Pro tips for each place

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState<[number, number] | null>(null);
```

### Location Detection
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (position) => {
        setUserLocation([position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude]);
      }
    );
  }
}, []);
```

### Data Fetching
```typescript
const foodPlaces = await fetchRealFoodPlaces(userLocation);
const restaurants = foodPlaces.map(convertToRestaurant);
```

### Data Conversion
```typescript
const convertToRestaurant = (place: FoodPlace): Restaurant => {
  // Converts OpenStreetMap data to display format
  return {
    id: place.id,
    name: place.name,
    category: place.category,
    rating: place.rating,
    // ... generated vibe, tips, etc.
  };
};
```

## Testing

### To Test Location Awareness:

1. **Allow Location Access**
   - Browser will ask for permission
   - Click "Allow" to get accurate results

2. **Try These Queries:**
   - "Good coffee spot near me"
   - "Budget-friendly restaurants"
   - "Fast food nearby"
   - "Local Filipino cuisine"

3. **Check Results:**
   - Should show restaurants near YOUR location
   - Not hardcoded to Cebu
   - Real data from OpenStreetMap

### Location Fallback
If location is denied:
- Falls back to Manila coordinates: `[14.5995, 120.9842]`
- Still provides recommendations
- User can manually set location later

## Benefits

### For Users
- ‚úÖ Get recommendations for THEIR area
- ‚úÖ No need to specify location
- ‚úÖ Always relevant results
- ‚úÖ Works anywhere

### For Developers
- ‚úÖ Uses existing `fetchRealFoodPlaces()` function
- ‚úÖ Leverages OpenStreetMap API
- ‚úÖ Consistent with map page data
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Address Resolution
Convert coordinates to readable addresses:
```typescript
const address = await geocode(latitude, longitude);
// "Ayala Center Cebu, Cebu City"
```

### 2. Distance Calculation
Show distance from user:
```typescript
const distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, restaurant);
// "0.3 km away"
```

### 3. Caching
Cache location data for better performance:
```typescript
const cachedPlaces = localStorage.getItem('nearbyPlaces');
```

### 4. Location History
Remember recently searched locations:
```typescript
const searchHistory = ['Cebu City', 'Manila', 'Davao'];
```

## Error Handling

### No Location Permission
```typescript
if (!userLocation) {
  return "Please enable location access for better recommendations";
}
```

### No Results Found
```typescript
if (restaurants.length === 0) {
  return "No places found. Try a different query or expand your search area.";
}
```

### API Errors
```typescript
catch (error) {
  return "Sorry, couldn't fetch recommendations. Please try again.";
}
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Before**: Hardcoded Cebu restaurants, static data
‚úÖ **After**: Real-time location-based recommendations from OpenStreetMap

‚úÖ **Works anywhere** in the Philippines (or anywhere OpenStreetMap has data)
‚úÖ **Real restaurant data** from the same source as your map
‚úÖ **Dynamic quick actions** based on location, not city
‚úÖ **Better UX** - no need to specify location
