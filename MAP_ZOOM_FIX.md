# Map Zoom Fix - "View on Map" Button

## Problem
When clicking "View on Map" from AI recommendation cards, the map wasn't zooming into the restaurant location properly.

## Solution
Updated the map page to:
1. Smoothly zoom to the restaurant location
2. Add a special marker
3. Automatically search for nearby places
4. Show a popup with restaurant info

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Ref for Restaurant Marker**
```typescript
const restaurantMarkerRef = useRef<any>(null);
```
- Stores the marker so it can be removed/updated
- Prevents marker duplicates

### 2. **Improved Zoom Animation**
```typescript
mapRef.current.setView(coordinates, 18, { animate: true, duration: 1.5 });
```
- Zoom level: 18 (close-up)
- Smooth animation: 1.5 seconds
- Better UX with animated transition

### 3. **Delayed Popup Display**
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  restaurantMarkerRef.current?.bindPopup(...).openPopup();
}, 1600); // Wait for zoom animation
```
- Waits for zoom to complete before showing popup
- Prevents popup from being cut off

### 4. **Auto-Search Nearby Places**
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  searchFoodPlaces(coordinates);
}, 2000);
```
- Automatically fetches nearby restaurants after zoom
- Shows food places around the selected location
- Enables exploration right away

### 5. **Marker Cleanup**
```typescript
if (restaurantMarkerRef.current) {
  mapRef.current.removeLayer(restaurantMarkerRef.current);
}
```
- Removes previous markers when navigating to new locations
- Prevents marker clutter

## How It Works Now

### User Journey:
1. **User clicks "View on Map"** in AI assistant
2. **Navigates to map page** with coordinates in URL
3. **Map smoothly zooms** to level 18 over 1.5 seconds
4. **Special marker appears** with restaurant name
5. **Popup shows** restaurant info
6. **Nearby places load** automatically around location

### URL Format:
```
/map?lat=10.3157&lng=123.8854&restaurant=Bintana Coffee House
```

## Technical Details

### Zoom Levels:
- Level 1: Whole world view
- Level 10: City view
- Level 15: Neighborhood view
- **Level 18**: Street/building detail (what we use)
- Level 22: Maximum detail

### Animation Duration:
- Duration: 1.5 seconds
- Provides smooth transition
- Not too fast, not too slow

### Marker Styling:
- Purple background (#8c52ff)
- White border for visibility
- Restaurant name in marker
- 80x32px size
- Centered anchor point

### Popup Content:
```html
<div>
  <h3>Restaurant Name</h3>
  <p>Click on the map to explore nearby places!</p>
</div>
```

## Testing

### Test Steps:
1. Go to `/feed` (AI assistant)
2. Type: "Good coffee spot near me"
3. Click a recommendation card
4. Click "View on Map" button
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Map smoothly zooms to location
   - ✅ Purple marker appears with restaurant name
   - ✅ Popup shows restaurant info
   - ✅ Nearby places load automatically
   - ✅ No duplicate markers

### Expected Behavior:
```
Before: Map doesn't move or zooms awkwardly
After:  Smooth zoom → Marker → Popup → Nearby places
```

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Smooth zoom animation
- ✅ Clear marker for selected restaurant
- ✅ Automatic nearby place discovery
- ✅ Can explore immediately without extra clicks

### For Developers:
- ✅ Clean ref management
- ✅ Proper cleanup on navigation
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Reusable pattern

## Code Flow

```
handleViewOnMap(restaurant)
    ↓
router.push(`/map?lat=${lat}&lng=${lng}&restaurant=${name}`)
    ↓
Map page detects URL params
    ↓
useEffect triggers
    ↓
Remove old markers
    ↓
Animate zoom to level 18
    ↓
Add restaurant marker
    ↓

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Add Distance Display
```typescript
const distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, restaurant);
// "0.3 km away from your location"
```

### 2. Route Planning
```typescript
const route = L.Routing.control({
  waypoints: [userLocation, restaurant.coords]
}).addTo(map);
```

### 3. Street View Integration
```typescript
const streetViewUrl = `https://maps.google.com/?q=${lat},${lng}`;
// Link to Google Street View
```
